            <h3>QR Code Docker</h3>
            <p>
                In my "Building Web Applications" class, not only did we work with pandas, but we also worked with
                docker containers.
                One of the assignments was to take some given code and edit parameters to be able to direct it to a
                certain website,
                in this case our Docker Hub Repository.
            </p>
            <h3>Paragraph Processing App</h3>
            <p>
                In my "Advanced Programing for Information Technology" class, we worked in Android Studios to make
                simple applications.
                One of the projects we made was a paragraph processing app. The app would accept a .txt file and the
                user would input a
                option of how they wanted to process the .txt file. The process chosen and the inputed .txt file will be
                processed via server
                sided processing, and the output will be returned and displayed on the user's screen.
            </p>
            <h3>Unity Painting App</h3>
            <p>
                Through out the duration of the course, we worked on a painting app. Each lesson we were able to
                experiment with the variables
                and assets of the app to meet the milestone requirements. We implemented features such as animations,
                color changing,
                shape and size changing, a dynamic clock that was synced to the user's computer time, and made the app
                mobile compatible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is a play test build that was uploaded to itch.io. This was during the first phase of the project.
                This part
                is the simple painting aspect of the program, where you can stroke or dot a sphere anywhere in the
                viewable canvas.
                <br>
            <blockquote>
                Right click and drag for a stroke brush or left click for dotting.<br>
            </blockquote>

                The QR code generated by the code above is linked to the NJIT website. Feel free to scan the QR code to
                try it.
                The code will generate a QR code, then make a new folder - images, and place that QR code into that
                folder so the
                user is able to view it.
