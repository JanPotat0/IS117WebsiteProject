            <h3>Python Pandas</h3>
            <p>
                In my "Building Web Applications" class, my professor assigned a project where we would have to work
                with a data set - state and population.
                For the requirements, the project would be grabbing data of the given csv file. It should get the min
                and max,
                calculate the standard deviation, calcuate a sample size of a given confidence interval and margin of
                errors,
                and print the results to a csv file in a desginated folder using pandas.
                <br><br>
                The code shown on the right takes in a .csv file - state_population.csv, reads and puts it into a pandas
                data frame for calculations.
                As mentioned before, the program is supposed to get the min and max, the length or row count, and the
                calculate the standard deviation.
                Separately from these calculations, the program had to calculate a sample size of varying confidence
                intervals for each margin of error value.
                In the third screenshot, a nested for loop is used to iterate through each margin of error with
                iterating confidence intervals -
                thus producing fifteen .csv files named as such - sample_data_number_confidence interval_margin of
                error_line count.
            </p>
            <h3>Arcade Website</h3>
            <p>
                I took a class over the summer - "Internet Applications", where the class would choose among three
                diffeent options,
                an online shop, a banking site, or an arcade website. All these sites were made with HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.
                I chose to do the arcade prject, where there was a login function for the user to create an account for
                saving scores and credits.
                There was a game with the site where the user can play a game - snake, to earn credits to create a
                competition and compete for
                spots on a daily, weekly, monthly, or all-time leaderboards. The user's login information, scores,
                credits, and user roles where kept.
