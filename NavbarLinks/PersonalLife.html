                    I usually like to spend my weekends or freetime playing or listening to music, working out,
                    playing games and talking with old highschool friends, and spending time with my family.

                    I started playing guitar during highschool, and still play today - I am one of the lead guitarists for my
                    church. I also play a little bit of bass and ukelele, and I used to play piano when I was younger, but I
                    am slowly getting back into it. <br>
                    I usually play the guitar when I'm stressed or want to take a quickbreak. It takes my mind off of things,
                    so I can refocus afterwards. I find it more enjoyable to play out of the instruments. I also like to take after
                    my dad because he is the main reason why I got into guitar.
                </p>

                    I like to hangout with friends from highschool. Whenever everyone is free, we usually like to hangout sometimes
                    in my basement, or we go to places like New York to walk around or checkout cool shops. If we can't go somewhere,
                    we usually go into a discord call and just play games or watch a tv show together.

                <h2>Other Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    At school, I usually attend the archery club. I wanted to join a club during my time in college,
                    so me and my friend decided to join the club and now we attend the weekly practices. <br>
                    Other days I like to stay home and take the time to clean my room after doing other chores.
                    I find it relaxing and satisfying seeing my room organized and cleaned. After cleaning, I like to workout
                    and do some practice of martial arts - which I used to do throughout middle school until freshman year highschool.<br>

                    In addition to playing music, I sometimes write some of my own songs - above is the Digital Audio Workstation I use.
                    I don't sing, but I like to make instrumental songs where I make multiple instances of an instrument
                    and just layer them over each other to make it sound like a band. I don't release these songs,
                    because they are usually incomplete, but I do plan to release them to a music streaming platform in the future.
